# Is the King James Version inspired?

There are lots of translations out there. Which one is perfect, if any?
Can any translation be from God?

This repository exists to investigate (and hopefully prove or disprove) the claim that the King James Version, 
with standardized spelling as established in the 1700s, is preserved by God's direct intervention.

This repository started because I was investigating the numerical properties of Genesis 1:1, Revelation 22:21 and
2 Corinthians 10:9.

# Why would counting letters prove the inspiration of the KJV?

It is a pattern which seems to be alluded to in the text itself (2 Corinthians 10:9) eerily indicating
that this is, in fact, a feature of the text which is of God.

I do not know if this pun, (letters of an alphabet versus written letters you send someone, i.e. "Dear Theophilus...") exists in the greek.

My guess would be "Probably not".

# Why not Gematria?

Gematria is an invented way of getting numbers from text, but it isn't something that can be readily analyzed by
someone who has no prior knowledge.

God tends to favor the poor and the needy. He loves them.

A poor person will have a very hard time remembering what every letter of the alphabet is in gematria (I doubt even
gematria experts have them memorized!)

but the poor and impoverished could open their King James Bible and count vowels (A E I O U and sometimes Y)
and verify what someone told them.

If you are wondering about Revelation 13:18 being a proof of gematria being biblical... well, I mean,
it doesn't actually mention it.

Why don't you try analyzing Revelation 13 18 using this program?
I think the verses you'll get are... rather interesting.

# What about KJV variants?

Different printed editions of the KJV sometimes come with printing errors. This is no different than there being
scribal errors in a particular transmission (Obviously not all of them are kept perfect by God.)

It is the current belief of the author of this repository that the Oxford 1769 is the perfectly translated and preserved edition.
I believe these websites both have the same text:
https://thekingsbible.com/
Or here:
https://textusreceptusbibles.com/KJV1769/
The latter explicitly claims to have the Oxford 1769, while the former simply lines up in a couple textual variants
I have checked and prayed about.

I don't know where to find tab-delimited copies of the Oxford 1769 KJV out there.
If you are willing to create one that works with this program, I will gladly add it to this repository.
The PCE (Pure Cambridge Edition) is what is included here, because Bible Protector provides a tab-delimited edition of it.

Please note that Revelation 22:21 had to be modified from the included original text document to remove the uninspired addition, `<<THE END>>`
which is included in the text document.
If you decide to overwrite bible.txt with that text document, you will have to re-do this modification!

# Why not The 1611?

Well, first of all, if we're getting that semantic about versions and editions, there isn't really a "The 1611". There are multiple variants of the 1611 too!

Whether or not there is a printed edition or single copy of the 1611 which is word-for-word identical to the 1769 edition is still up-for-grabs.
I believe there probably is an early printed KJV which is identical. This is just a hunch.
Furthermore, I have heard that the translators actually continued to make changes to the print until 1638, so
it is arguable that the translation work may not even have been finished with the first printed publications.

Again, as I mentioned above, there being variant prints of the 1611 is no different than scribal errors appearing
in various transmissions.

# Is it possible for an english text to fully encapsulate the meaning of the hebrew/greek?
I would argue no. The english can never replace the hebrew, but it can be perfectly translated.
There are puns in the hebrew which are theologically important. 
Notably...
Netser- THE BRANCH 
which is mentioned explicitly in Isaiah 11:1, and Zech 6:12 via a synonym for netser, 
the prophecy of "He shall be called a Nazorean".


It is possible that a particular reading of every single verse could have been chosen by God to end up in the KJV.
Which is my current stance.

# What original language texts do you compare against?

When arguing about what the original autographs said, we typically run to a number of different manuscripts and transmissions.


I would tend to prefer the masoretic and majority texts for the OT, but the septuagint (Which is a greek translation of the OT)
would also be relevant.


The NT? I know less about it. Alexandrian transmissions are poor, and the Textus Receptus is actually a composite compilation
based on a number of manuscripts.


I still have unanswered prayers about where I can find perfect copies of the 66 books in their original languages, if they are even available!


# "I can prove the KJV is not inspired!"

I've seen lots of these. Lots of them are using modern definitions of words that had different meanings in the past,
ignoring the context of a verse, or claiming baselessly that a particular rendering is "unsupported in the original manuscripts".

Regardless, post it in the issues of this repository.

Let me list off some common objections that are not actual disproofs:

One of the most recent ones I think I've solved is "How old was Ahaziah when he began to reign?"

Here is my resolution:


He reigned when his father was ill in the eleventh year of Joram (2 Kings 9:29), when his father died in the twelfth year of Joram (2 Kings 8:25-26)
and twenty years later after "the house of Ahaziah was unable to keep still the kingdom" (2 Chron 22:9) he was actually
officially crowned ceremonially as king in Jerusalem, to reign a single year before his death at the hands of Jehu and his men.

(It is an outstanding question whether his mother Athaliah would still have been capable of reigning for six years after Ahaziah died.)



"Acts 12:4 should say passover!"
This one backfires massively. Passover has already passed (Acts 12:3) So was Peter held in prison for a whole year?
You can say that passover refers to the entire festival (Passover + Unleavened Bread) but I am not sure there is
evidence that this is a valid resolution.
Furthermore, John seems to act as if "Pascha" in the greek can refer to something other than the Jewish pesach.
John 2:13 "And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,"


"You can't dig brass out of a hill, it is an alloy (Deut 8:9)"
You can dig the materials to make brass out of hills.
The very same verse mentions stones that "are" iron.
Unless you actually believe that Israel is filled with stones made of pure ferrum, I'm afraid you've lost this one.
Furthermore, it is debatable whether or not the use of "Brass" in english antiquity could also refer to Copper.
(I have yet to investigate)


"<verse> isn't supported in any manuscripts the KJV is supposedly based on!"
I think the actual exact manuscripts the KJV translators used may not even be available or exist today.



"Thou shalt not revile the gods? (Ex 22:28)"
This one is the best attempt at debunking the KJV I've found so far.
The very next verse discusses offerings to the God of Israel.
The translation of "Elohim" to "gods" here would at first seem totally out-of-context and violating
any sensible translation rules.

However, Jesus said something interesting on this very subject!

“Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?” (John 10:34)

The actual quote comes from Psalm 82:6, however, the jews typically made a distinction between the Law and
the Psalms and the Prophets.

Furthermore, Psalm 82:6 seems to be past tense. "I have said" not "I say".
This would suggest that it was previously stated elsewhere.

As far as I know, there is nowhere in the Law of Moses that you can find God referring to people as gods...
Unless you count this verse right here!

Thus, "gods" here is not referring to the false idols of the nations, but rather to the judges and high officials
over any group. A parallel verse to the pauline command not to resist authority (Romans 13:1-2), and the command 
in the gospels to render unto caesar what is caesar's (Matthew 22:21)

The verse in question is talking about the rulers of the people, which would obviously include God, the government of Israel,
the judges who have authority to judge in israel, and most likely the angels which are given authority and power by God as well.

# Can I use this repository?
All the code is in the public domain.
The KJV text is of course public domain, and bible-protector provides it for free with an implicit recommendation to print/use/share,
but they do not publish a license.


As such, the repository as a whole cannot be said firmly to be public domain, but the .c and .h files in this repository are.


(to clarify these files are public domain: main.c, stringutil.h, README.md, and Makefile)


I cannot confirm that bible.txt and TEXT-PCE-127-TAB.txt are public domain, although bible protector would most likely claim they are.
The work tab delimiting the text may or may not be public domain.

TL;DR
YES. But if you are going to redistribute, please credit Bible Protector for the Bible text documents.
