# Is the King James Version inspired?

There are lots of translations out there. Which one is perfect, if any?
Can any translation be from God?

This repository exists to investigate (and hopefully prove or disprove) the claim that the King James Version, 
with standardized spelling as established in the 1700s, is preserved by God's direct intervention.

This repository started because I was investigating the numerical properties of Genesis 1:1, Revelation 22:21 and
2 Corinthians 10:9.


# What about KJV variants?

Different printed editions of the KJV sometimes come with printing errors. This is no different than there being
scribal errors in a particular transmission (Obviously not all of them are kept perfect by God.)

It is the current belief of the author of this repository that the Oxford 1769 is the perfectly translated and preserved edition.
I believe these websites both have the same text:
https://thekingsbible.com/
Or here:
https://textusreceptusbibles.com/KJV1769/
The latter explicitly claims to have the Oxford 1769, while the former simply lines up in a couple textual variants
I have checked and prayed about.

I don't know where to find tab-delimited copies of the Oxford 1769 KJV out there.
If you are willing to create one that works with this program, I will gladly add it to this repository.
The PCE (Pure Cambridge Edition) is what is included here, because Bible Protector provides a tab-delimited edition of it.

Please note that Revelation 22:21 had to be modified from the included original text document to remove the uninspired addition, `<<THE END>>`
which is included in the text document.
If you decide to overwrite bible.txt with that text document, you will have to re-do this modification!

# Why not The 1611?

Well, first of all, there isn't really a "The 1611". There are multiple variants of the 1611 too!

Whether or not there is a printed edition or single copy of the 1611 which is word-for-word identical to the 1769 edition is still up-for-grabs.
I believe there probably is an early printed KJV which is identical. This is just a hunch.
Furthermore, I have heard that the translators actually continued to make changes to the print until 1638, so
it is arguable that the translation work may not even have been finished with the first printed publications.

# Is it possible for an english text to fully encapsulate the meaning of the hebrew/greek?
I would argue no. The english can never replace the hebrew, but it can be perfectly translated.
There are puns in the hebrew which are theologically important. 
Notably...
Netser- THE BRANCH 
which is mentioned explicitly in Isaiah 11:1, and Zech 6:12 via a synonym for netser, the prophecy of "He shall be called a Nazorean".

It is possible that a particular reading of every single verse could have been chosen by God to end up in the KJV.
Which is my current stance.

# What original language texts do you compare against?

When arguing about what the original autographs said, we typically run to a number of different manuscripts and transmissions.

I would tend to prefer the masoretic and majority texts for the OT, but the septuagint (Which is a greek translation of the OT)
would also be relevant.

The NT? I know less about it. Alexandrian transmissions are poor, and the Textus Receptus is actually a composite compilation
based on a number of manuscripts.

I still have unanswered prayers about where I can find perfect copies of the 66 books in their original languages, if they are even available!

# Can I use this repository?
All the code is in the public domain.
The KJV text is of course public domain, and bible-protector provides it for free with a recommendation to share, but they do not publish
a license.
As such, the repository as a whole cannot be said firmly to be public domain, but the .c and .h files in this repository are.
(to clarify these files are public domain: main.c, stringutil.h, README.md, and Makefile)
I cannot confirm that bible.txt and TEXT-PCE-127-TAB.txt are public domain, although bible protector would most likely claim they are.
Their work tab delimiting the text may or may not be public domain.
